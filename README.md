Hi there, I'm Adriana Delgado.

I am a data analyst with a passion for solving hard problems and a business value-add mindset. Previously, I have developed solutions and analysis in various domains including financial analysis, economic reaserch, sales, amongst other fields. I studied Economics and Business with a focus in technology and finance at ESEN, El Salvador.

I'm fluent in English and Spanish. When not working with data, you can catch me watching sports, reading, or enjoying music. I love to learn and some of my favorite topics to read and write about are: politics and women's rights.
